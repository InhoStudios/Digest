# Digest
A smart summary and article digest app, allowing you to find key points efficiently from research papers, books, and articles

## Why Digest?
Many of my friends and peers often talk about just how many readings there are for their courses, assignments, or otherwise, and how it would be so nice to be able to get this information in a clean, presentable, and digestible manner. Digest does just that. This project aims to use AI and natural language processing to efficiently read through bodies of text and extract key information, details, and statistics, and present all of this information in a creative, easy to read, and engaging format.
